# Land Registry Using Blockchain

# Overview
This project is a blockchain-based Land Registry System that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof land ownership records. It leverages Ethereum smart contracts (Solidity) to prevent fraud, disputes, and inefficiencies caused by centralized or manual record-keeping.

# Features
✅ Land Registration – Registers land with a unique ID, location, area, and owner details.
✅ Fraud Prevention – Ensures only unregistered land can be added.
✅ Secure Ownership Transfer – Only the current owner can sell or transfer land.
✅ Instant Verification – Anyone can check land details via blockchain.

# Technology Used:
1. Blockchain – Ethereum
2. Smart Contract Language – Solidity
3. Development Environment – Remix IDE

# How It Works
1. Land Registration: A new land parcel is registered with owner details.
2. Ownership Verification: Users can check the ownership status of any registered land.
3. Property Transfer: The current owner can transfer ownership securely.
